Assignment 2

Select five level 2 directories and save their contents in one file, "listing.md". Here "level 2" directory is for example /home/mylogin/, but not /tmp/ (level 1) or /usr/local/bin/ (level 3). Contents = listing of filenames.

First I checked current directory using pwd command.
I reverse back to main folder using cd .. command twise.
After that I used cd /etc command and used ls command to list the contents of a directory.
